### Why functional is AWESOME?

* no extra setup in testing
* no randomly failing tests
* simple given -> expected tests 
* no problems of mutating shared state
* transparency
* small functions are enforced by paradigm
* decoupled data from behaviour
* easy caching / memoisation
* determinism feels right :)
